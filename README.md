## Overview ##

__How do I load this in Battlescribe?__

Battlescribe is abandonware and this dataset no longer supports it. If you really want, you can load it manually, but it will be extremely glitchy (e.g. reinforcing units does not double their points cost). Use New Recruit instead.

__I found a bug!__ / *I have another request*

Great, thank you! Please [Report a bug][bug report] - you can also suggest enhancements and raise other issues there.
