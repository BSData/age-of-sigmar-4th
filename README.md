## Overview ##

__How do I load this in Battlescribe?__

Battlescribe is abandonware and this dataset no longer supports it. If you really want, you can load it manually, but it will be extremely glitchy (e.g. reinforcing units does not double their points cost). Use New Recruit instead.

__I found a bug!__ / *I have another request*

Great, thank you! Please [Report a bug][bug report] - you can also suggest enhancements and raise other issues there. Make sure your issue has not already been reported.

__How do I create regiments in New Recruit?__ 

When you create a list, you will have a single parent force loaded with your general army composition options like lores and battle formation. to add a regiment (or auxiliary units), navigate to the sidebar and select the Forces category. You can add a child force there. Click your faction name and then Regiment or Auxillary as needed (each regiment will need its own force). You can also add regiments of reknown in this manner. To quickly navigate to unit entry for a specific regiment, click its header in the list view. That will scroll the sidebar panel to that regiment's selections where you can add units to it as needed.
