## Overview ##

__How do I load this in Battlescribe?__

Battlescribe is abandonware and this dataset no longer supports it. If you really want, you can load it manually, but it will be extremely glitchy (e.g. reinforcing units does not double their points cost). Use New Recruit instead.

__I found a bug!__ / __I have another request__

Great, thank you! Please [Report a bug][bug report] - you can also suggest enhancements and raise other issues there. Make sure your issue has not already been reported.

__How do I create regiments in New Recruit?__ 

When you create a list, you will have a single parent force loaded with your general army composition options like lores and battle formation. to add a regiment (or auxiliary units), navigate to the sidebar and select the Regiments and Auxiliary category. You can add a child force there. Click your faction name and then Regiment or Auxiliary as needed (each regiment will need its own force). You can also add regiments of renown in this manner. To quickly navigate to unit entry for a specific regiment, click its header in the list view. That will scroll the sidebar panel to that regiment's selections where you can add units to it as needed.

__Will full support for Path to Glory: Ascension (from the Core Rulebook) be added?__ 

It's being worked on. Unlike Path to Glory: Ravaged Coast, Ascension uses a split system where you track a seperate roster of available units that you then build lists from. There isn't a clean way to do this in Battlescribe or New Recruit, and the closest possibility requires restructuring the data in a way that I believe may break some existing lists. As a result, I plan to do the overhaul with the release of the GHB to minimize damages.
